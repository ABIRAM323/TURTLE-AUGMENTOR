# üê¢ TURTLE AUGMENTOR
### Dataset Augmentation for Fine-Tuning LLMs using RAG

## Overview
**Turtle Augmentor** is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the conversion of unstructured textual content (like PDFs and research papers) into **structured conversational datasets** in a Question-Answer (Q&A) format.

These high-quality datasets are optimized for **fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)** and training AI chatbots. The system uses **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance contextual coherence and accuracy in the generated data.

## Key Technologies
The project uses a modular architecture built on advanced NLP and retrieval tools:
* **Augmentation/Generation:** Uses the **Flan-T5** model for automated question generation.
* **Retrieval:** Integrates **FAISS** for efficient similarity search and **LangChain** for enhanced contextual retrieval.
* **Processing:** Employs **PyMuPDF** for document parsing and recursive text splitting.
* **Architecture:** Uses a **Python Backend API** with a Vite/React.js Frontend UI.
